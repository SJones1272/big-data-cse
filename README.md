big-data-cse
============

This library provides a code framework to facilitate the incorporation of large, online data sets into introductory programming courses. The goal of the library is to relieve students from low-level issues of reading and parsing raw data from web-based data sources, while interfacing with data structures and representations defined by users themselves. In addition, the library requires minimal syntactic overhead to use its functionality.

# Supported Data Sources

The `big.data` library currently supports loading data files from either the local filesystem or a web URL.
